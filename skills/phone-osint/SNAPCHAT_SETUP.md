# Snapchat Account Verification - Complete Setup Guide

**🚨 EXTREME RISK WARNING: SNAPCHAT HAS THE HIGHEST BAN RISK OF ALL PLATFORMS**

Snapchat has the **most aggressive anti-automation detection** of any messaging platform. Even minimal automated use will likely result in **PERMANENT ACCOUNT BAN** within hours or days.

**STRONG RECOMMENDATION: Use MANUAL verification method** (documented below). Manual checking is safer, more reliable, and ToS-compliant.

## Critical Risk Assessment

### Ban Risk Comparison

| Platform | Ban Risk | Detection Sophistication | Recommended Method |
|----------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Snapchat** | **EXTREME** 🔴 | Very High | **Manual Only** |
| Telegram | Moderate 🟡 | Medium | Automated with caution |
| WhatsApp | Moderate 🟡 | Medium | Automated with caution |

### Why Snapchat is Different

**Snapchat's Anti-Bot System**:
- Device fingerprinting (checks device model, OS version, screen resolution)
- Behavioral analysis (human interaction patterns)
- Rate limiting (extremely aggressive)
- Machine learning-based bot detection
- Requires valid Android/iOS device parameters
- Frequently changes API endpoints to break automation
- Permanent bans with no appeal process

**What This Means**:
- Automated tools break frequently (within days/weeks of Snapchat updates)
- Even sophisticated automation gets detected quickly
- Account bans are **permanent and irreversible**
- No warning before ban - account disabled immediately
- Cannot appeal or recover banned investigation numbers

### Expected Outcomes

**Manual Verification**:
- ✅ Safe and ToS-compliant
- ✅ Reliable results
- ✅ No ban risk
- ✅ Takes ~2-3 minutes per check
- ⚠️ Leaves minimal trace (contact sync)

**Automated Verification**:
- ❌ Almost certain account ban within days/weeks
- ❌ Unreliable (libraries frequently broken)
- ❌ Violates Snapchat ToS
- ❌ May not work at all
- ❌ Not worth the risk for most investigations

---

## Manual Verification Method (RECOMMENDED)

**This is the ONLY recommended method for Snapchat verification.**

### What You Need

1. **Investigation Phone** with Snapchat app installed
   - iPhone or Android device
   - Dedicated to investigations (not personal device)
   - Snapchat account registered with investigation phone number

2. **Google Voice Number** (or burner number)
   - Dedicated investigation number
   - Registered with Snapchat
   - Acceptable loss if eventually banned

3. **5 Minutes** per check
   - Actual checking takes 2-3 minutes
   - Documentation adds 2-3 minutes

### Advantages of Manual Method

✅ **Safe**: No automation = no ban risk
✅ **ToS Compliant**: Contact syncing is a legitimate Snapchat feature
✅ **Reliable**: Always works (no broken libraries)
✅ **More Information**: Can view public profile, Bitmoji, Stories
✅ **No Setup**: Just need Snapchat app (no API credentials, libraries, etc.)
✅ **Sustainable**: Won't get investigation number banned
✅ **Auditable**: Easy to document with screenshots

### Disadvantages

⚠️ **Manual Effort**: Requires human interaction (not scriptable)
⚠️ **Slower**: 2-3 minutes per check vs. seconds for automated
⚠️ **Trace**: Target may see you in "Quick Add" if mutual contacts exist
⚠️ **Privacy**: Requires syncing contacts (privacy consideration)

**Verdict**: Despite disadvantages, manual is **strongly recommended** for Snapchat.

## Why Manual is Better Than Automated

### Technical Comparison

| Aspect | Manual Verification | Automated Verification |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Ban Risk** | None | 95%+ (almost certain) |
| **Setup Time** | 5 minutes | 2-4 hours (if working) |
| **Reliability** | 100% | 10-30% (often broken) |
| **Maintenance** | None | High (breaks with Snapchat updates) |
| **Data Retrieved** | Username, display name, Bitmoji, public profile | Username only (if library works) |
| **Documentation** | Screenshots | JSON logs |
| **ToS Compliance** | ✅ Compliant | ❌ Violation |
| **Sustainability** | Indefinite | Days/weeks until ban |

### Real-World Scenario

**Manual Method**:
```
Time: 2:30 PM
Action: Add target number to contacts
Result: Contact synced, Snapchat account appears
Data: Username @threat_actor_123, name "John Doe"
Screenshot taken, documented in case file
Time spent: 3 minutes
Account status: Safe
```

**Automated Method**:
```
Day 1, 2:30 PM: Set up Python environment (2 hours)
Day 1, 4:30 PM: Install snapchat-py library (fails, outdated)
Day 1, 5:00 PM: Try alternative library (fails, broken)
Day 2, 10:00 AM: Find working library, configure device parameters
Day 2, 11:00 AM: Successfully check 1 number
Day 2, 2:00 PM: Check 3 more numbers
Day 3, 9:00 AM: Account BANNED (all investigation numbers lost)
Result: 4 checks completed, then permanent ban
Time spent: 6+ hours, lost investigation account
```

**Conclusion**: Manual method is faster, safer, and more reliable.

## Step-by-Step Manual Verification

### Prerequisites

1. **Investigation Phone Setup**
   - iPhone (iOS 14+) or Android (10+)
   - Snapchat app installed and updated
   - Snapchat account registered with Google Voice number
   - Privacy settings configured (see below)

2. **Privacy Configuration**
   - Open Snapchat → Profile → Settings (gear icon)
   - **Who Can...** settings:
     - Contact Me: My Friends (or Everyone for investigations)
     - View My Story: My Friends
     - See My Location: My Friends (or Ghost Mode)
     - See Me in Quick Add: Off (important!)
   - **Additional Services**:
     - Manage → Permissions → Contacts: Allow
   - **Mobile Number**:
     - Let Others Find Me: Off (prevents targets from finding you)

### Daily Manual Verification Workflow

#### Step 1: Prepare Investigation Phone

**Add Target Number to Contacts**:

1. Open **Contacts** app on investigation phone
2. Tap **+** (Add Contact)
3. Enter phone number: `+1-555-987-6543`
4. First Name: `Investigation` (or case ID)
5. Last Name: `Target001` (or identifier)
6. **Save**

**Why**: Snapchat syncs contacts to suggest friends. This is a legitimate feature.

#### Step 2: Sync Contacts in Snapchat

**Open Snapchat**:

1. Open Snapchat app
2. Tap **Profile icon** (top left, your Bitmoji)
3. Tap **Add Friends** (+ button)
4. Tap **Contacts** tab

**Grant Access** (if first time):
- "Snapchat Would Like to Access Your Contacts"
- Tap **OK** or **Allow**

**Wait for Sync**:
- Snapchat syncs contacts (takes 5-30 seconds)
- Refresh by pulling down if needed

#### Step 3: Check Results

**If Snapchat Account Exists**:

The contact will appear in one of these locations:

1. **"Contacts" section** (most common)
   - Shows username (e.g., `@johndoe123`)
   - Shows display name
   - Shows Bitmoji (if set)
   - **+ Add** button appears

2. **"Quick Add" section** (if mutual contacts exist)
   - Same information as above
   - May also show mutual friends count

**If No Snapchat Account**:
- Contact does NOT appear in Snapchat
- Only shows up in your phone's Contacts app (not in Snapchat)

#### Step 4: Gather Information

**Tap on the Snapchat profile** (do NOT add them):

**Public Information Visible**:
- ✅ Username (e.g., `@johndoe123`)
- ✅ Display Name (e.g., "John Doe")
- ✅ Bitmoji avatar
- ✅ Snap Score (if public)
- ✅ Public Stories (if they post public Stories)
- ⚠️ **Do NOT add them as friend** (leaves trace)

**Take Screenshots**:
1. Screenshot the profile view
2. Screenshot showing username and display name
3. Save screenshots to secure investigation folder

#### Step 5: Document Findings

**Create Investigation Note**:

```
SNAPCHAT VERIFICATION - MANUAL METHOD

Case ID: BEC-2026-001
Date: 2026-01-02
Time: 14:30 UTC
Investigator: [Your Name]

PHONE NUMBER CHECKED:
+1-555-987-6543

RESULT:
[X] Snapchat account FOUND
[ ] Snapchat account NOT FOUND

ACCOUNT DETAILS (if found):
Username: @threat_actor_123
Display Name: John Smith
Bitmoji: Yes (business attire avatar)
Snap Score: 12,543 (moderately active)
Public Story: Yes (checked, posted 2 hours ago)
Verification Badge: No

OBSERVATIONS:
- Display name matches CEO name (impersonation suspected)
- Public Story shows luxury lifestyle (possible social engineering)
- No verification badge (red flag - real CEO would likely be verified)

SCREENSHOTS:
- snapchat_profile_20260102_1430.png
- snapchat_username_20260102_1430.png

CROSS-REFERENCE:
- WhatsApp: ✓ REGISTERED
- Telegram: ✓ REGISTERED (@fake_ceo_john)
- Consistent impersonation pattern across platforms

CONCLUSION:
Strong evidence of CEO impersonation. Recommend escalation.
```

#### Step 6: Clean Up

**Delete Contact from Phone**:

1. Open **Contacts** app
2. Find the investigation contact (e.g., "Investigation Target001")
3. Tap **Edit**
4. Scroll down → **Delete Contact**
5. Confirm deletion

**Why**: Removes the contact from phone so they don't persist in future syncs.

**Note**: The Snapchat profile may still appear in "Quick Add" for a while due to caching. This is normal.

**Do NOT**:
- ❌ Add them as a friend on Snapchat (creates permanent trace)
- ❌ Send them a Snap (reveals your investigation account)
- ❌ View their private Stories (they'll see you viewed)

#### Step 7: Log for Compliance

**Create JSON Log** (for audit trail):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-02T14:30:00Z",
  "caseId": "BEC-2026-001",
  "phoneNumber": "+1-555-987-6543",
  "formattedNumber": "15559876543",
  "platform": "Snapchat",
  "method": "manual_verification",
  "isRegistered": true,
  "accountDetails": {
    "username": "threat_actor_123",
    "displayName": "John Smith",
    "hasBitmoji": true,
    "snapScore": 12543,
    "hasPublicStory": true,
    "isVerified": false
  },
  "investigator": "security@wmg.com",
  "screenshots": [
    "snapchat_profile_20260102_1430.png",
    "snapchat_username_20260102_1430.png"
  ]
}
```

Save to: `logs/snapchat_result_manual_1735848600000.json`

## Automated Method (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**⚠️ READ THIS FIRST**: This section documents automated verification for completeness, but it is **NOT RECOMMENDED** due to extreme ban risk and low success rate.

**Use manual method instead** unless you:
- Have technical expertise in reverse engineering
- Accept that investigation account WILL be banned
- Are willing to lose days of setup time when libraries break
- Need to check hundreds of numbers (even then, manual may be faster due to ban rate)

### Why Automated Snapchat Checking Fails

1. **No Official API**: Snapchat provides NO legitimate API for this use case
2. **Reverse-Engineered Libraries**: All libraries (snapchat-py, pysnap, etc.) are reverse-engineered and break frequently
3. **Device Fingerprinting**: Requires emulating real Android/iOS device
4. **Frequent API Changes**: Snapchat changes APIs specifically to break automation
5. **Aggressive Detection**: Machine learning-based bot detection catches automation quickly
6. **Permanent Bans**: No appeal process, lost investigation number

### Available Libraries (All Unreliable)

| Library | Language | Status | Last Updated | Reliability |
|---------|----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| snapchat-py | Python | ⚠️ Outdated | 2018 | 10% |
| pysnap | Python | ❌ Broken | 2017 | 0% |
| snapchat.py | Python | ⚠️ Unreliable | 2020 | 15% |
| node-snapchat | Node.js | ❌ Broken | 2016 | 0% |

**Reality**: Most libraries are 3-6+ years old and no longer work.

### Setup (For Reference Only)

**If you insist on trying automated** (against recommendations):

1. **Get Investigation Phone Number**
   - Google Voice (same as WhatsApp/Telegram)
   - Register Snapchat with this number
   - Configure privacy settings

2. **Install Python & Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts/
   pip install snapchat-py  # Will likely fail or not work
   ```

3. **Device Parameters**:
   - You'll need to provide Android device fingerprint
   - This requires reverse engineering or device emulation
   - Beyond scope of this guide

4. **Run Script**:
   ```bash
   python snapchat_check.py "+1-555-987-6543"

   # Expected: Will show manual verification guide instead
   # Automated mode requires --force-automated flag
   ```

### Expected Result

**Most Likely Outcome**:
```
❌ Snapchat library not available: snapchat-py library error
RECOMMENDATION: Use manual verification method instead
```

**If Library Works** (rare):
```
Checking +1-555-987-6543...
[5-30 second delay]
Account BANNED (error code 403)
Investigation number lost permanently
```

**Success Rate**: < 20% even with working library

## Troubleshooting

### Manual Verification Issues

#### Issue: Contact Not Appearing in Snapchat

**Possible Causes**:
1. Number not registered on Snapchat (correct result)
2. Contact sync not enabled
3. Number format incorrect
4. Privacy settings preventing sync

**Solutions**:
```
1. Verify contact sync enabled:
   Snapchat → Settings → Manage → Permissions → Contacts: Allow

2. Try different number formats:
   +1-555-123-4567
   15551234567
   (555) 123-4567

3. Force re-sync:
   - Delete contact from phone
   - Re-add contact
   - Snapchat → Add Friends → Contacts → Pull down to refresh

4. Manual verification:
   - Ask the contact directly (if appropriate for investigation)
   - Check publicly posted Snapchat username (if available)
```

#### Issue: Target Appears in "Quick Add" But Not Sure If Correct Person

**Solution**:
- Compare username with other OSINT sources
- Check Bitmoji style (matches personality?)
- View public Story content (if available)
- Cross-reference with WhatsApp/Telegram display names
- Look for mutual friends (could indicate shared network)

#### Issue: Investigation Account Banned

**Cause**: Despite manual verification being safe, account can be banned for:
- Excessive contact sync/unsync patterns
- Too many contact adds/deletes in short time
- Using VPN or suspicious IP addresses
- Other ToS violations

**Solution**:
```
1. Accept the ban (no appeal possible)
2. Get new Google Voice number
3. Register new Snapchat account
4. Wait 24-48 hours before starting checks
5. Reduce check frequency (longer delays between checks)
```

### Automated Verification Issues

#### Issue: Library Not Installing

```bash
pip install snapchat-py
# Error: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement
```

**Solution**: Library is outdated/removed. **Use manual verification instead.**

#### Issue: Authentication Failed

**Cause**: Snapchat requires device-specific parameters that library doesn't provide.

**Solution**: **Use manual verification instead.**

#### Issue: Account Banned After First Check

**Expected**: This is normal with Snapchat automation.

**Solution**:
1. Don't appeal (reveals automation use)
2. Get new investigation number
3. **Switch to manual verification method**

## Best Practices

### For Manual Verification

✅ **DO**:
- Use dedicated investigation phone (not personal)
- Configure privacy settings to minimize trace
- Document all checks with screenshots
- Delete contacts after verification
- Wait reasonable time between checks (hours, not minutes)
- Encrypt screenshots when archiving
- Cross-reference with other platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram)

❌ **DO NOT**:
- Add targets as friends (leaves permanent trace)
- Send Snaps or messages to targets
- View their private Stories (they'll see you viewed)
- Sync hundreds of contacts at once (pattern detection)
- Use personal Snapchat accounts
- Screenshot private content (ToS violation)

### Rate Limiting (Manual Method)

**Recommended Pace**:
- **5-10 checks per day** maximum
- **Wait 30-60 minutes** between checks
- **Spread throughout day** (not all at once)
- **Delete contacts** after each check

**Why**: Even manual contact syncing can trigger flags if done excessively.

### Investigation Hygiene

**Before Each Check**:
1. Confirm authorization for specific phone number
2. Document investigation case ID
3. Prepare case notes template

**During Check**:
4. Add contact to phone
5. Sync in Snapchat
6. Take screenshots immediately
7. Document findings

**After Check**:
8. Delete contact from phone
9. Save screenshots to investigation folder
10. Log in case management system
11. Update OSINT report

## FAQ

### Q: Why is manual verification recommended for Snapchat but not WhatsApp/Telegram?

**A**: Snapchat has significantly more aggressive anti-automation:
- WhatsApp/Telegram: Moderate ban risk, automation can work for weeks/months with caution
- Snapchat: Extreme ban risk, automation often banned within hours/days

The risk/reward ratio makes manual verification the only practical option for Snapchat.

### Q: Can targets see that I checked them on Snapchat?

**A**: Depends on method:

**Manual Verification**:
- ⚠️ May appear in their "Quick Add" if you have mutual contacts
- ⚠️ Will NOT appear if no mutual contacts (most cases)
- ✅ If you DON'T add them, they won't get notification
- ✅ If you DON'T view their Story, they won't see you

**Automated Verification**:
- ⚠️ May trigger API alerts visible to Snapchat (not user)
- ✅ User won't see anything (if automation works at all)

**Bottom Line**: Manual is low-trace if done carefully.

### Q: How long does manual verification take?

**A**:
- Add contact: 30 seconds
- Sync in Snapchat: 30 seconds
- Check results: 30 seconds
- Take screenshots: 30 seconds
- Document findings: 2 minutes
- Delete contact: 30 seconds

**Total: ~4-5 minutes** per check (including documentation).

For investigations with < 50 numbers, manual is actually **faster** than debugging broken automation.

### Q: What if automated libraries start working again?

**A**: Even if libraries are fixed:
- Ban risk remains extreme
- Snapchat will break them again in next update (within days/weeks)
- Manual method remains more sustainable

**Recommendation**: Stick with manual unless you need to check hundreds/thousands of numbers.

### Q: Can I use Snapchat's search feature instead?

**A**: No.
- Snapchat search only finds usernames, not phone numbers
- Phone number search is blocked by privacy settings
- Contact sync is the ONLY method to verify phone number → Snapchat account

### Q: Is there an official Snapchat API I can use?

**A**: No.
- Snapchat offers NO official API for account verification
- Snap Kit API is for app integration, not phone number lookups
- This is intentional (privacy protection)

### Q: What about paying for a OSINT service that includes Snapchat?

**A**: Be cautious.
- Most OSINT services do NOT have official Snapchat access
- They likely use the same unreliable automation (high ban risk)
- May not work reliably
- Check their methodology before purchasing

**Manual verification remains most reliable.**

## Appendix: Investigation Number Lifecycle

### Expected Lifespan

**Manual Verification**:
- **Indefinite** with proper rate limiting
- Rotate every 90 days as precaution

**Automated Verification** (if attempted):
- **1-7 days** before ban (most common)
- **Hours to weeks** in best case
- **Permanent ban** after 1st check (worst case)

### When to Rotate

**Manual Method**:
- Every 90 days (proactive)
- If account shows suspicious activity warnings
- If investigation number becomes known to targets

**Automated Method** (N/A):
- After ban (no choice)
- Every 1-2 weeks preemptively (if somehow not banned yet)
